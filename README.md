# Great Circle Distance From Latitude, Longitude, And Radius

This program computes the great circle distance between two points given their latitudes, longitudes, and the radius of the sphere they're both on. It uses [the haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) and accepts input in degrees. The unit of length used for the radius determines the unit of length given as output.
